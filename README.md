# Non-negative Universal Differential Equations (nUDE)

This repository contains the implementation of non-negative and regularised universal differential equations (UDEs) and supplemental material accompanying the 2024 FOSBE publication "Non-Negative Universal Differential Equations With Applications in Systems Biology" [1]. It builds on the PEtab package for specification of a parameter estimation problem, AMICI for simulation and pyPESTO as an interface for parameter estimation.
